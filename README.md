# Python Gen-AI Developer Assignment

## Overview

This project fetches data from a paginated API, processes each response to identify citations from provided sources, and displays the results using a Streamlit interface.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   
   https://github.com/jaypanchal18/task_18-05-2024

2. install libraries
   pip install -r requirements.txt


3. For run
   streamlit run main.py



*NOTE*: - 

If the API doesn't work, you can try running the demo.py file. I have inserted some mock data in it. 
You can use 'streamlit run demo.py' to run it.
